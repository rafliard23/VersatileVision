# VersatileVision

Versatile Vision is an attempt to do image processing within node-red environment. At current state we utilize node-red ``exec`` and ``daemon`` node to run our python program within node-red.

This project is part of my final project. The purpose of the study is to create system device which capable to recognize object using image processing based on contour detection method and filtering process.

The performance of object detector model is here, system only tested on single class classification
